This is a CLI capable of reading events from a midi hardware device (knobs,
sliders, buttons) and mapping them to system actions (shell commands, keyboard
shortcuts, etc).

## Python tooling

- Preferred tooling: uv, ruff, pytest, typing, pre-commit, github actions.
- Repeated actions are scripted on a justfile.

## Other notes

Don't add yourself as cowriter on git commit messages.
